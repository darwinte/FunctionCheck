FunctionCheck is now splited into two parts:
  - the profiler itself, which generates profile data files
      called FunctionCheck (this archive)
  - the dump program that convert profile data files into
      human readable informations called FunctionDump

They are two reasons for that:
  - it is easier to deal with automake/autoconf/configure
      with this architecture
  - some may want to have the profiler and treat themselve
      the profile data files, as the file format is quiet
      easy to read and understand

  * I finished my PhD thesis last december. I have time
      to work on functioncheck.
