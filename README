FunctionCheck by Y.Perret (V3.0)
----------------------------------


Please, send me a mail if you have any trouble to configure,
compile, install or run this project. It will help me to improve
my code and make a more portable archive.



Description of directories:
---------------------------


  ./         : the README, with details on FunctionCheck profiler,
               the configure, the NEWS/ChangeLog which resume changes.

  ./src      : directory which contains sources for the profiler.

  ./doc      : documentation place. Documentation in HTML and .info format.

  .test/     : some test examples for various situations (fork, threads,
                 memory allocations, shared objects...)
	       Note: in order to run examples, special targets are
	         defined. For example to run the 'test' example you can
		 use 'make run-test'. Try 'make help' for more details.


How to compile/install:
-----------------------

 - extract the files from the archive
 - enter the archive
 - run the 'configure' script with needed options
   additionnal option: --enable-debug: allow debug messages while profiling
 - if you have problems to compile, try to run
     'automake' and 'autoconf' before running 'configure'.

Note: a special target 'help' is given with the makefile to remind you
      the available targets.
