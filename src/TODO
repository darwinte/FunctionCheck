TODO list. If you want to contribute, you can choose any
of these points... :o)

* [ok] correct local time calculation for recursive functions
* [changed] in fork mode, duplicate the parent context for new
processes
  => empty functions in the stack to allow exits from
     unkown functions during profile
* limit of 16 exits from unknown functions
* {ok] limit of 64 contexts
* make some performance tests to improve the code
* [ok] time between exit() and the previous function entering is discarded
  => time is only discarded in case of 'core dump'
* make some performance tests with multi-pipes system
* [ok] add ressource files (see fc_ressource.[ch])
* [ok: to test] add time-loop management to allow executions > 1H12
* time between forks and next action -> redefine of 'fork' ?

Code improvment:
* use 'static' for local functions/variables
* use 'inline' for small functions
* change the message format in order to allow size-variable messages,
    depending of the kind of message. Note: it MUST be sent
    with only one 'write' (for multi-thread safety).


later:
* [ok] tests for the configuration stuff
  => only on my computer + solaris
* internationalization stuff (examples?)
